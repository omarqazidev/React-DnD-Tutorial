# React DnD Tutorial

## What is React DnD
[React DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) is a set of React utilities to help you build complex drag and drop interfaces while keeping your components decoupled. It is a perfect fit for apps like Trello and Storify, where dragging transfers data between different parts of the application, and the components change their appearance and the application state in response to the drag and drop events.

## Tutorial
This code shows you a simple example of React DnD using **TypeScript**.
